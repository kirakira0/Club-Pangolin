                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Pangolins, or "scaly anteaters" are small mammals native to Asia and Maya Sub-Saharan Africa.
                        Their major defense mechanism, as well as their most prominent feature, is a covering of large,
                        protective keratin scales that run from the middle of their heads down to the tips of their tails.
                        Pangolins have been driven to near extinction by deforestation and poaching, and according to
                        the International Union for Conservation of Nature, these mild-mannered, largely defenseless
                        animals are the most trafficked mammals in the world. To learn more about the pangolin and what
                        you can do to help, we highly suggest visiting the <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/the-fight-to-stop-pangolin-extinction" target="_blank">
                         World Wildlife Fund</a> and the <a href="https://www.awf.org/wildlife-conservation/pangolin" target="_blank">African Wildlife
                        Foundation's</a> websites. You may also enjoy playing some of the games we have developed to learn
                         about pangolins in a more interactive way.
