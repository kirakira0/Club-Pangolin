# Club Pangolin

## Introduction
Welcome to Club Pangolin, an online, multiplayer RPG similar to the dearly missed “Club Penguin” game, but it features the critically endangered scaly anteater, or pangolin. The game will offer players a unique take on “Club Penguin” with new environments, minigames, and features, all while educating players on the effects of poaching. Our  app provides a fun and educational experience that helps our users pass time in an engaging yet still relaxing environment.

Club Pangolin was brought to you by Kira Toal, Julian Gonzales, Josh Stukenborg, and Maya Epps.
